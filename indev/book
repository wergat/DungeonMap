[[
The map works by making tons of rooms, going up and down, with connections.
The \"connections\" can block you, make passage difficult, or just let you through.
You can go up and down with stairs found randomly without the rooms.
]],
[[
The rooms are totally random; some are water fountains, others are pits of fiery death.
]],
[[
Chests are mini-rewards in some of the rooms. Dialog quests are just one way to get them.
They contain a variety of materials, such as equipment, food, and potions.
Loot is randomized based off of the Chest's difficulty, or level.
]],
[[
Occasionally, you can find little shops with villagers that trade currency (page 9) for equipment.
Like Chests, villagers are graded based off of difficulty. The higher, the better.
1/10th of the time, Drug Dealers will spawn, which will sell you randomized and pre-set potions.
]],
[[
Potions are randomized based off of a difficulty value. They can have a mix of positive and negative effects.
They spawn in chests, and Drug Dealers will sell them aswell.
You can find negative splash potions to troll, and positive potions. Be warned; the better, the more costly!
]],
[[
Equipment always have a gold value, seen if you hover over it. Gold is the \"currency value\".
1000 gold = 1 diamond; 1 emerald = 5 diamonds; 1 gold block = 1 emerald; 20 iron = 1 diamond.
Shops usually have a Currency Trader to exchange material value.
]],
[[
This map has mobs; what is a map without them?
Mobs, like everything else, have a level. The farther you progress, the higher this is.
What they wear is determined from the level; level 2000 zombies have full enchanted diamond, while level 2 zombies have nothing.
]],
[[
Usual, Unusual, Rare, Extraordinary, Rare, Epic, Mythical, Legendary, Forgotten. Those are rarity values.
The rarity values get more costly and rare as it increases; Forgotten items go for at least $1mil.
]],
[[
Sets are legendary and forgotten quality. They contain 5 items, armor & weapon, and contain the same prefix.
For example, the Kitten's set contains Kitten's Paws (boots) and Kitten's Wrath (sword).
4/5 of the time, any legendary/forgotten item will become a set.
]],
[[
Around the map, villagers that talk can spawn that will offer to give you a quest for some loot.
Developers can add their own quests that are generated randomly, aswell.
]],
[[
Installing mods is designed to be as easy as possible.
Each mod has it's own ID on Pastebin that serves as the unique identifier.
To install a mod, type \"dungeon/install_mod\", then type the identifier provided.
]],
[[
A few confirmations might appear. Usually you can just type \"y\", but not always.
After that, you're done! The mod has been installed. It will check for updates on boot and run automatically.
